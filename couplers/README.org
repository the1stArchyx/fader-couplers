* Existing fader couplers and their dimensions

This document describes the features of the fader coupler designs
already created.

The easiest way to measure fader spacing is to measure the width of
sheet metal between two fader's cutouts and add the width of a fader
cutout. If there are buttons or screw heads between faders, their size
needs to taken into account.
