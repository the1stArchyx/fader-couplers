* 3D-printable fader coupler

This repository contains OpenSCAD sources for fader couplers that can
be pushed on a pair of existing fader knobs, eg. on an analog audio
mixer. The original purpose was to couple two mono channels for stereo
operation on a Soundcraft FX16ii mixer.

The source files can be adapted to fit practically any mixer
imaginable. Existing renditions fit for the mixer mentioned above, for
channel and bus faders, are available in OpenSCAD source and STL
files for 3D-printing.

Any new variations of these couplers brought to any maintainer of this
repository will be added for subsequent free use. If you're not
confident enough to modify the script yourself, you may open an issue
with fader knob size, spacing, and clearance measurements to get help
with creating a perfectly fitting coupler. However, printing
tolerances may not be compensated for at scripting stage.
